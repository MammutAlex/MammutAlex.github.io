# Alex Co-Founder & CTO Cargofy

I am a technology enthusiast and an avid explorer with a passion for science and adventure.

Before joining **[Cargofy](https://cargofy.com/)**, I worked at the **[Space Research Institute](http://www.ikd.kiev.ua/)**, where I was involved in developing cutting-edge technology for space exploration. The experience has honed my skills in innovative problem-solving, strategic planning, and project management.

I also run a **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@alex-kovalchuk)** where I share my experiences, tips, and tricks on technology and exploration. I love interacting with fellow enthusiasts and sharing knowledge with others.

Through this website, I hope to share my insights on technology, adventure, and life in general. Join me on this journey as we explore the world of technology and adventure together.
